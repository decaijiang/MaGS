# Reconstructing and Simulating Dynamic 3D Objects with Mesh-adsorbed Gaussian Splatting

## Introduction
Mesh-adsorbed Gaussian Splatting (MaGS) is a novel approach for reconstructing and simulating dynamic 3D objects. MaGS combines the rendering flexibility of 3D Gaussians with the spatial coherence of meshes. This method facilitates accurate rendering and realistic deformation of dynamic 3D scenes.

For more information, visit the [project page](https://wcwac.github.io/MaGS-page/) and [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01593/).

## Code
The implementation of MaGS will be made available soon. Stay tuned for updates.
