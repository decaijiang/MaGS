# Reconstructing and Simulating Dynamic 3D Objects with Mesh-adsorbed Gaussian Splatting

## Introduction
**Mesh-adsorbed Gaussian Splatting (MaGS)** is a novel framework for reconstructing and simulating **dynamic 3D objects**.  
It combines the rendering flexibility of **3D Gaussians** with the spatial coherence of **meshes**, enabling both high-quality rendering and realistic deformation in dynamic scenes.

## Dataset Preparation

### 1. D-NeRF Dataset

1. **Download the dataset**

   * Original dataset: [D-NeRF (official)](https://github.com/albertpumarola/D-NeRF)
   * Fixed version: [Deformable-3D-Gaussians](https://github.com/ingra14m/Deformable-3D-Gaussians)

2. **Download the meshes archive**

   * Get **`D-NeRF_meshes.7z`** from the [release page](https://github.com/wcwac/MaGS/releases/tag/v0.0.1).

3. **Organize and extract**

   * Put both the image data and `D-NeRF_meshes.7z` in the **same** directory.
   * Extract both archives. You should get a structure like:

     ```
     bouncingballs/
     â”œâ”€â”€ train/
     â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ r_000.png
     â”‚   â””â”€â”€ r_001.png
     â”œâ”€â”€ train_meshes/
     â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ r_000.ply
     â”‚   â””â”€â”€ r_001.ply
     â”œâ”€â”€ test/
     â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ r_000.png
     â”‚   â””â”€â”€ r_001.png
     â””â”€â”€ test_meshes/
         â”œâ”€â”€ r_000.ply
         â””â”€â”€ r_001.ply
     ```

> The `.ply` files let you reproduce the paperâ€™s results immediately.
> Scripts for generating meshes from scratch (and for additional scenes) will be released soon.

### 2. DG-Mesh Dataset

The steps are similar to D-NeRF, with just a few differences:

1. **Download the dataset**

   * Dataset: [DG-Mesh](https://github.com/Isabella98Liu/DG-Mesh)

2. **Download the meshes archive**

   * Get **`DG-Mesh_meshes.7z`** from the [release page](https://github.com/wcwac/MaGS/releases/tag/v0.0.1).

3. **Organize and extract**

   * Same procedure as in the D-NeRF case â€” place both archives in the same directory and extract.
